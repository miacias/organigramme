# Organigramme

Employee database that records working departments and roles along with employee records and chains of command within a company.


## Description

As a personal business grows in size and new employees join as stakeholders, the collective company becomes more intricate and complicated. Oftentimes, modern companies, especially start-ups, grow exponentially quickly, and managing each employee can become difficult. In larger, more established companies, employee management can be equally difficult when working with teams abroad or with third-party contractors from all over. This project aims to provide a database-solution to keeping track of all stakeholders of a given business, from managers to non-managers across all departments and roles. 

I learned that querying a database via MySQL must have perfect syntax, as MySQL is a very unforgiving language. Database languages in general are extremely powerful and can deftly adjust and display information with just the right type of table joins. This first experiment with MySQL allows for room for growth in honing queries and returned values so that the database can be managed even more effectively.
